# App to help you start, read and finish a book

### Problem:
#### My initial problem was that i'm buying to many books, didn't finish for some reason and drop the book. The interest of reading almost never came back.

### How i came up with the solution:
#### Once i started a new read, i was contantly trying to break my avarage page count, this keep the pacing steady. That's the secret, keeping the consitency until you finish the book.

Some of the things i had to keep in mind while it's the key thing should make the user feels rewarded when he updates a read(i'm still trying to figure that part out)
